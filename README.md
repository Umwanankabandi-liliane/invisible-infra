## Invisible Infra

**Invisible Infra** is a deep-tech infrastructure intelligence project that uses **physics-aware artificial intelligence** and **satellite/environmental data** to detect hidden failures and losses in critical infrastructure systems—such as **water, power, and gas networks**—**without installing physical sensors**.

###  The Problem

Cities and utilities operate aging infrastructure with limited real-time visibility.
Failures are often detected **after** service disruption, and traditional sensor-based monitoring is expensive, slow to deploy, and incomplete at city scale.

###  The Solution

Invisible Infra provides a **non-invasive, scalable AI platform** that:

* Ingests satellite imagery and climate data
* Applies physics-aware machine learning models
* Detects anomalies, degradation, and loss hotspots
* Produces prioritized maintenance insights for decision-makers

All **without hardware deployment**.

###  Why It’s Different

* No physical sensors required
* City-scale coverage from day one
* Faster deployment than traditional monitoring
* Explainable AI grounded in physical system behavior

###  Who It’s For

* Municipal governments
* Water, electricity, and gas utilities
* Infrastructure operators
* Infrastructure investors and resilience programs

###  Project Status

* Early-stage, pre-incorporation
* Currently applying to the **UC Berkeley Gateway Accelerator**
* Website serves as a project landing page and concept demonstration
